Provide recommendations for expanding the movie collection based on popularity and rental rates.
Revenue Optimization:

Analyze rental rates to identify trends and the profitability of various pricing categories.
Determine the most rented movie categories and ratings to maximize revenue.

### Operational Efficiency:
